                    <h2>MARS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its iron
                        oxide-rich surface, which gives it a reddish appearance. Roughly half the size of Earth, Mars
                        has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon.
                        Temperatures can vary widely, from about 20°C (68°F) near the equator during the day to -125°C
                        (-195°F) at night near the poles.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mars features some of the most dramatic landscapes in the solar system, including Olympus
                        Mons—the tallest volcano—and Valles Marineris, a canyon system over 4,000 km long. It also has
                        two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, likely captured asteroids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scientists are deeply interested in Mars because it may have once supported life. Evidence
                        suggests the planet had liquid water in the past, and some regions may still harbor subsurface
                        ice or briny water. Robotic missions, like NASA's Perseverance rover, are exploring Mars to
                        study its geology and seek signs of past life.

                    <h2>MOON</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is the fifth largest moon in the solar system. It is
                        about 1/6th the size of Earth and has a diameter of approximately 3,474 km. The Moon's surface
                        is covered with craters, mountains, and flat plains called maria, formed by ancient volcanic
                        activity.
                        The Moon has a very thin atmosphere, which means it cannot support life as we know it. Its
                        surface temperature varies widely, ranging from about 127°C (260°F) in direct sunlight to -173°C
                        (-280°F) in the dark.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Moon has a synchronous rotation with Earth, meaning the same side always faces our planet. This
                        is due to gravitational forces that have slowed its rotation over billions of years. The far side
                        of the Moon, often mistakenly called the "dark side," is not permanently dark; it simply faces
                        away from Earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Moon has been a focal point for human exploration, with the Apollo missions landing astronauts
                        on its surface between 1969 and 1972. The Moon continues to be a target for future exploration,
                        with plans for lunar bases and missions to study its resources and geology.

                    <p>
                        Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and
                        helium. It has a diameter of about 139,822 km, making it 11 times wider than Earth. Jupiter's
                        atmosphere features colorful bands of clouds, storms, and the famous Great Red Spot, a massive
                        storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and is surrounded by a vast system of rings and at least 79
                        moons, including the four largest known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
                        Callisto. These moons are of great interest to scientists, especially Europa, which is believed to
                        have a subsurface ocean that may harbor conditions suitable for life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jupiter's immense size and mass give it a strong gravitational pull, influencing the orbits of other
                        celestial bodies in the solar system. It has a very short day, completing a rotation in about 10
                        hours, but takes nearly 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
                        The planet has been studied extensively by spacecraft, including the Galileo orbiter and the Juno
                        mission, which is currently studying its atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior structure.

                    <p>
                        Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is renowned for its stunning ring system, which is the most
                        extensive and complex in the solar system. It is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and
                        helium, with a diameter of about 116,460 km, making it the second-largest planet after Jupiter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saturn's rings are made up of countless ice and rock particles, ranging in size from tiny grains to
                        large chunks. The rings are divided into several main sections, with gaps and divisions caused by
                        the gravitational influence of Saturn's moons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saturn has a total of 83 known moons, with Titan being the largest. Titan is unique because it has a
                        thick atmosphere and surface lakes of liquid methane and ethane, making it a prime target for
                        astrobiological studies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saturn has a relatively short day, completing a rotation in about 10.7 hours, but it takes about 29.5
                        Earth years to orbit the Sun. The planet's atmosphere features bands of clouds and storms, similar
                        to Jupiter, but with a more subdued appearance.

                    <p>
                        Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, is a gas giant known for
                        its striking blue color, which is due to the absorption of red light by methane in its atmosphere.
                        It has a diameter of about 49,244 km, making it the fourth largest planet in terms of diameter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neptune has a dynamic atmosphere with strong winds and storms, including the Great Dark Spot, a
                        massive storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The planet has a faint ring system and at least
                        14 known moons, with Triton being the largest. Triton is unique because it has a retrograde orbit,
                        suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune's gravity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neptune takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun and has a day length of
                        approximately 16 hours. Its distance from the Sun makes it one of the coldest places in the solar
                        system, with temperatures dropping as low as -214°C (-353°F).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neptune was discovered in 1846, and its atmosphere has been studied by various spacecraft, including
                        Voyager 2, which provided valuable data about its composition and weather patterns.

                    <p>
                        Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant known for its unique blue-green color,
                        which is caused by the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It has a diameter of about 50,724 km,
                        making it the third largest planet in terms of diameter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Uranus is unique among the planets because it rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98
                        degrees. This unusual tilt results in extreme seasonal variations and unusual weather patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The planet has a faint ring system and at least 27 known moons, with Titania and Oberon being the
                        largest. Uranus takes about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun and has a day
                        length of approximately 17.24 hours.

                    <p>
                        Uranus was discovered in 1781 by Sir William Herschel and was the first planet discovered with a
                        telescope. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of water,

                    <p>
                        Venus, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet," is the second planet from the Sun and is
                        similar in size and composition to Earth. However, its atmosphere is vastly different, primarily
                        composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet in the solar
                        system with surface temperatures averaging around 467°C (872°F).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Venus has a thick atmosphere that creates a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat and leading to
                        extreme surface conditions. The planet has a rocky surface with mountains, valleys, and numerous
                        volcanoes, some of which may still be active.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, while
                        its orbit around the Sun takes about 225 Earth days. This results in a day on Venus being longer
                        than its year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Venus has no moons or rings, and its surface is shrouded in thick clouds, making it difficult to
                        observe directly. The planet has been studied by various missions, including NASA's Magellan
                        spacecraft, which mapped its surface using radar.
